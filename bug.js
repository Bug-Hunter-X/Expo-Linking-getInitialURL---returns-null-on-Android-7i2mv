This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links. The `getInitialURL()` method might return `null` even if a deep link is opened, causing unexpected behavior in your application. This is particularly problematic on Android devices where the delay in receiving the URL can lead to a null value being processed before the actual URL is available.  The root cause isn't always clear but might be related to asynchronous operations or delays in the system's response to the incoming intent.
